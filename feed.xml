          <title>Albert finally has a website</title>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;Until recently the information relevant to the user was cluttered over several places. For a motivation there was a small landing page on github-pages, the github repository had a README.md, which basically served the same purpose, to get help the user had to go to the wiki and for newsâ€¦ well there was nothing. Finally there is now a place where everything gets merged to a single website: The project website &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://albertlauncher.github.io&quot;&gt;albertlauncher.github.io&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using &lt;a href=&quot;https://jekyllrb.com/&quot;&gt;Jekyll&lt;/a&gt; and a handcrafted theme based on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://milligram.github.io/&quot;&gt;Milligram CSS framework&lt;/a&gt; the static website offers a nice reading experience and is still somewhat maintainable for a lazy c++ guy. The docs are dynamically generated from markdown sources and allow Github users to send pull request for modifications, e.g. typos. News post are dynamically generated too and even build a RSS news feed to allow interested users to subscribe and be up to date.&lt;/p&gt;
